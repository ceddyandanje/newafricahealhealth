The user wants to add two new pages:
1.  `/emergency/alerts`: To show a detailed, filterable list of active alerts.
2.  `/emergency/history`: To show a log of all past incidents.

This requires creating two new page files. I will create placeholder pages for now that can be built out later.

Here are the changes.
