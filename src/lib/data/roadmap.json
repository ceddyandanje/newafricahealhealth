This task involves moving all product data into a 'products' collection in Firestore. \n\n**Data Handling:** Each product should be a separate document. This will allow admins to dynamically add, edit, and delete products from the admin panel instead of needing code changes. The public-facing product pages will then fetch data from this collection.",
